## General info
The game is of the "non-life" type, but the exercises performed in this game pay off during the subsequent memorization of anything, reduced time spent on building the association, and its effectiveness and durability.

I built the game using C ++ in the Qt framework.
The exercises are devoid of critical technical errors, but the "Travers" option is heavily bugged.

Project is: _no longer continue_ 
>I abandoned the project because I started learning the front end.

## Inspiration
The exercise is from the course of [!Marcin Kowalczyk](http://kazdytakmoze.pl/), a multiple world record holder in memorizing, but there you practice using regular cards and a stopwatch.
As part of the exercises, I built this game to make my life easier and eliminate the exercises of shuffling cards, unfolding them, turning the stopwatch on and off (which is distracting) and manually keeping statistics of my mistakes / progress
